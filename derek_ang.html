                <h4>2015</h4>
                <p>5/29/2015</p> Derek has been taking Spanish for three years in high school. He speaks with good accents but would do well to improve his speed. This will require some time and practice but I feel after a month or two, his skills will improve quite a bit. We are scheduled three times during the next month. I have asked if I can record our sessions (he has no problem with this) so I can keep track of his progress.
